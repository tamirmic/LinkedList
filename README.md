The List342 project involves creating a templatized linked list class capable of managing ordered collections of various data types. The List342 class supports dynamic memory allocation, pointers, and file I/O, while also requiring an understanding of operator overloading, copy constructors, and assignment operators. This project builds on previous concepts of templates and linked lists to implement an efficient and versatile ordered list. The List342 class includes functions to construct lists, insert objects in the correct order, and manage duplicates by rejecting them. It provides methods for removing items, peeking at elements without deletion, merging two lists, and clearing the list entirely while deallocating all associated memory. Operators are overloaded to enhance usability. These include + and += for combining two lists into a sorted and duplicate-free result, << for displaying the list in ascending order, and comparison operators (== and !=) to test for equality or inequality. The assignment operator (=) ensures deep copying of all elements, and a destructor ensures proper deallocation of memory when a list is no longer in use.
